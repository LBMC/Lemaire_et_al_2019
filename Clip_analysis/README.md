# Description

This is the script used to build the figures corresponding to Clip density in the article : *Splicing factors and chromatin organization enhance exon recognition by alleviating constraints generated by gene nucleotide composition bias* of Lemaire *et al*.

To build the documentation for an unix system,  just go on``doc`` folder and type in a terminal :

```sh

make html
```

This wil create a folder `doc/build/html/`. Then launch the file `doc/build/html/index.html` to see the documentation.

You can also open the file `doc/source/README.rst` with a text editor to see the raw documentation.

The documentation was build thanks to [Sphinx][http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/] v1.7.
