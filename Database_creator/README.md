## Building the documentation

To build the documentation for an unix system,  just go on``doc`` folder and type in a terminal :

```sh

make html
```

This wil create a folder `doc/build/html/`. Then launch the file `doc/build/html/index.html` to see the documentation.

You can also open the file `doc/source/Readme.rst` with a text editor to see the raw documentation.

The documentation was build thanks to [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) v1.7.
