# Projects GC- AT- U1- U2-exons figures

## Description

This program aims to create several figures that shows, for GC/AT/U1/U2 exons, some of their proporties.

## Building the documentation

To build the documentation for an unix system,  just go on``doc`` folder and type in a terminal :

```sh

make html
```

This wil create a folder `doc/build/html/`. Then launch the file `doc/build/html/index.html` to see the documentation.

You can also open the file `doc/source/README.rst` with a text editor to see the raw documentation.

The documentation was build thanks to [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) v1.7.
